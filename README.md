# Arduino Output Library
Very simple and easy to use, see examples. Operates on an Arduino pin,
which is set to an  OUTPUT mode for the lifetime of the `Output` class
instance (`begin` must be called). The pin mode resets to INPUT during
`Output` instance destruction (or via `end` member method).
TODO: Add examples

This is still in beta, changes and/or comments are welcome.
